# Building Dimensional Model in BigQuery
- Define Use-Case
- Requirement Gathering
- Architecture Design
- Dimensional Modelling
- Physical Design & Development

1.  Use-Case (Northwind Traders)

The Northwind database is a sample database created by Microsoft to demonstrate the features of some of its products and for training and tutorial purposes.
The database contains all the sale data for North Traders, a fictitious speciality foods export-import company.
   Sales transactions between the company(Northwind traders) and its customers
   The purchase transactions between Northwind and its suppliers.
We will be using MySQL version of the Northwind sample database

Important to understand
- What
- Why 
- How

    - The WHAT?
- Northwind Traders are export-import company who trades around the world for speciality foods
- Their existing architecture is mostly a mix of on-premise & legacy systems, including their MySQL database which is primary operational database.
- This is where all the sales transactions are recorded between company and its customers
- Same MySQL database is also being used to generate reports & build analytical solutions
- They are struggling to keep up with reporting requirements and causing database to slow down impacting their day to day business
- Northwind traders want to modernise their data & reporting solutions and move away from on-premise

   - The WHY?
- They want to modernizse their existing infrastruture for 
  - Better scalability
  - Reduce load on operational systems 
  - Improve reporting speed
  - Improve data security

      - The HOW
- Northwind Traders will migrate their existing database system to Google Cloud Platform(GCP)
- MySQL on-premise will be replaced with a fully managed Cloud SQL for MySQL
- During this migration, they need help with setting up  OLAP system for reports
- BigQuery was selected to run OLAP
- Need to build high-priority  reports first to access new system and drive adoption
- Dimensional Data Warehouse will be build on BigQuery to support with reporting requirements



2. Requirements Gathering: 
- Define Business Processes( following Kimball Dimensionl )
- Conduct Data Profiling (Data Exploration)
- Create Bus Matrix High level entities
- Create Naming Convention Document
- Create Conceptual Model


2.1 Define Business Process
Requirements:
- Sales Overview:
    - Overall sales reports to understand better our customers what is being sold, what sells the most where and what sales the least, the goal is to have a general overview of how the business is going

- Sales Agent Tracking:
    - Tracking sales and performance of each sales agent to adjust commissions, reward high achievers and empower low achievers

- Product Inventory:
   - Understand the current inventory levels how to improve stock management, what suppliers do we have, and how much is being purchased. This will allow us to understand stock management and potentially broker better deals with supplier

- Customer Reporting:
   - Allow customers to understand their purchase orders, how much and when are they buying, empowering them to make data decisions and utilize the data to join their sales data

2.2 Data Profiling:
