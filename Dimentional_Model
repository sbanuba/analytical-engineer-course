    - The WHAT?
- Northwind Traders are export-import company who trades around the world for speciality foods
- Their existing architecture is mostly a mix of on-premise & legacy systems, including their MySQL database which is primary operational database.
- This is where all the sales transactions are recorded between company and its customers
- Same MySQL database is also being used to generate reports & build analytical solutions
- They are struggling to keep up with reporting requirements and causing database to slow down impacting their day to day business
- Northwind traders want to modernise their data & reporting solutions and move away from on-prem
