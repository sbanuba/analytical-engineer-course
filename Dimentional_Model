- Use-Case (Northwind Traders)
The Northwind database is a sample database created by Microsoft to demonstrate the features of some of its products and for training and tutorial purposes.
The database contains all the sale data for North Traders, a fictitious speciality foods export-import company.
   Sales transactions between the company(Northwind traders) and its customers
   The purchase transactions between Northwind and its suppliers.
We will be using MySQL version of the Northwind sample database

Important to understand
- What
- Why 
- How

    - The WHAT?
- Northwind Traders are export-import company who trades around the world for speciality foods
- Their existing architecture is mostly a mix of on-premise & legacy systems, including their MySQL database which is primary operational database.
- This is where all the sales transactions are recorded between company and its customers
- Same MySQL database is also being used to generate reports & build analytical solutions
- They are struggling to keep up with reporting requirements and causing database to slow down impacting their day to day business
- Northwind traders want to modernise their data & reporting solutions and move away from on-premise

   - The WHY?
- They want to modernizse their existing infrastruture for 
  - Better scalability
  - Reduce load on operational systems 
  - Improve reporting speed
  - Improve data security

      - The HOW
- Northwind Traders will migrate their existing database system to Google Cloud Platform(GCP)
- MySQL on-premise will be replaced with a fully managed Cloud SQL for MySQL
- During this migration, they need help with setting up  OLAP system for reports
- BigQuery was selected to run OLAP
- Need to build high-priority  reports first to access new system and drive adoption
- Dimensional Data Warehouse will be build on BigQuery to support with reporting requirements
