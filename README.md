- Data access security happens within data warehouse

# Advantages of ELT
- More data storage space required
- Could be slow due to muilti persistent of data
- Low compliance due to everything stored
- Security risk if not handled PII data correctly
- Fairly new technology due to popularity in cloud solutions
