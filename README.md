# ELT
# T in ETL

# Transformation:
- Cleansing: Solving and cleaning out any inconsistency
- Standardization: By applying formatting rules
- Deduplication: Removing duplicates and redduncy
- Verification: Flagging anomalies and remove unusable data
- Sorting: Organizing by type
- Other Task: Any other rules/tasks needed to apply


Tools: Airflow, Fivetran

# Advantages of ELT
- More flexibility than ETL approach, stores any type of data
- Enables to perform analysis on various data types with ease
- Ensures architecture future proof due to the data lake habdling data growth
- No longer requires DE to setup complicated pipelines
- Data access security happens within data warehouse

# Advantages of ELT
- More data storage space required
- Could be slow due to muilti persistent of data
- Low compliance due to everything stored
- Security risk if not handled PII data correctly
- Fairly new technology due to popularity in cloud solutions

# DATA MODELLING & ERD NOTATION
* Data Model:
   - Foundation to building DWH & BI solutions
   - Primary goal of the data model is to act as a blueprint
   - Helps buidling conceptual, logic, physical and models and define relatiosnhips
   - Defines how the logical structure of database is modeled
   - Specifies business requirements and data structure
   - Provides visual way to communicate with business at various level
   - Data Model is important part of the developement process(main communication methid between team)

* Data Modelling
   - Data modeling is the process itself
   - identifying and anylyse business requiremennts
   - Work with business on defining the dta model
       - Interview, meetings, reviewing existing process
   - Define ERD notation style
      - Information Engineering(IE), Chen's Style, Barker UML
   - Define the model type
      - Conceptual, Logic, Physical
   - Define Data Modelling Methodology
      - Relational data Models (ER data model)
      - Dimension Model

* ERD Notation
   - Creates a visual representation of the entities and the attributes
   - Provides a preview of how all  the tables should connect, what fields are going to be on each table
   - Puts forth the conceptual ideas in a readable format
   - ER diagrams used as  a blueprint for implementation

* Entity, Attributes Relationship
  - Entity: is a class of objects represented by a rectangle. This can be something that exists in the real world logically, physically or conceptually. Such as person, customer, employee, product, transaction, account.
 
  - Attributes are properties that describe an entity(for customer it'll be name, email, address etc
        - IE Notation: Attributes listed within the rectangle box
        - Chen Style: Represented by an oval shape, Specific type of attributes also exists: multivalue derived, unique(key), partial etc
        - Relationship Cardinality: Cardinality defines possible number of attributes occurance in one entity with another entity

    
    * Steps to Create an ERD:
   Identify Entity ---> Identify Relationship ---> I dentify Cardinality ---> Identify Attributes ---> ERD

* Types of Data Model: 3 types
  --
  - Conceptual Data Modle -> Business
      - Identify what the system contains but not the details
      - focus is to identify what data is used in business
      - This is the first version of the data model and can't be used to build a database
      - Goal of a conceptual data model is to act as a business requirement reference
      - Gives us understanding of high level and how each entity relates to each other
      - Doesn't describe the process flow itself
        
      - Features of Conceptual Data Model:
          - Doesn't show primary key or attributes
          - Shows entities and relationship
          - It's a high-level view for the business and shows a structure of data for business
          - It's independent of a database and not implementable ready
          - Very early stage of the modelling process where most of the concepts or objects might never made to the final pyhsical model
          - Identify and help with scoping requirements
          - Useful for PM as communication tool
          - It is part of what builds the final Entity Relationship Model
  --          
  - Logical Data Model -> Architect & BA
     - Identify how the system should be implemented
     - Focus on business requirements
     - Focus on the design of the data not physical implementation
     - Add additional information to the conceptual # Advantages of ELT
       
     - Features of Logical Data  Model
         - Primary key & foreign keys are present
         - All attributes are specified within an entity, will have data types
         - Relationships are specified using primary and foreign keys
         - Independent from DBMS
         - Normalization happens usually to 3NF

   - Physical Data Model
     - Identify how the system will be implemented for specific DBMS system
     - It is the blueprint for the developer
     - Depending on data modelling choice denormalisation can occur
     - Final result of Physical design can be different from Logical design
    
     - Features of Physical Data Model
         - Entities are now tables names
         - Attributes become columns names
         - Each column datatype, length, nullable is specified
         - Relationsh√≠p cardinality is defined

   - Different Types of Keys
     - Primary
     - Foreign key
     - Surrogate Key
     - Composite key
     - Natural key

   - Recommended Tools for ERD
      - Lucidchart
      - Draw.io
      - erwin Data Modeller
      - ER/Studio
      - MySQL Workbench

# NORMALISATION & DE-NORMALISATION

* Normalisation:
   - Normalisation splits large tables into small ones and joins them together using relationships
   - It is a way of organising data in our database and part of the modelling process
   - This enhances the distribution of data hence reducing data anomalies
   - This is why ER mnodels are a set of normalised tables and are used for transactional databases(OLTP)
   - Different levels of normal form and normalization rules
   - Minimises data redundancy and improvees data integrity
      - Data redundacy is where we have repeated number of rows at multiple places
   - Non normalised table takes more space and also creates data anomalies
      - 3 types of anomalies:
        - Insertion Anomaly
        - Deletion Anomaly
        - Modification (Update) Anomaly 
   - It is a way of orginise data in our database and part of the modelling process

 * Levels of Normalisation
    - First normal form (1NF)
    - Second normal form (2NF)
    - Third normal form (3NF) = ER Model
    - Fourth normal form (4NF) or Boyce Codd Normal Form(BCNF)
    - Fifth normal form(5NF)

   # 6: Data Warehouse Design Methodologies
   - Inmon:
       - Corporate Information Factory(CIF) created by Bill Inmon aka father of data warehouse
       - DWH is subject-oriented, integrated, time-variant and non-volatile
       - Starts with understanding and identifying the main subject used by the business
       - Enterprise Data Warehouse(EDW) is core of this architecture
       - All the enterprise data in a single data warehouse, centrally repository for all business data
       - Work with normalized data model
       - Data marts are created separately for each business function
       - Referred as a top-down or data-driven approach
    
       - Inmon CIF Architecture Components
