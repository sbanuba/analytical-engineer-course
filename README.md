# ELT
# T in ETL

# Transformation:
- Cleansing: Solving and cleaning out any inconsistency
- Standardization: By applying formatting rules
- Deduplication: Removing duplicates and redduncy
- Verification: Flagging anomalies and remove unusable data
- Sorting: Organizing by type
- Other Task: Any other rules/tasks needed to apply


Tools: Airflow, Fivetran

# Advantages of ELT
- More flexibility than ETL approach, stores any type of data
- Enables to perform analysis on various data types with ease
- Ensures architecture future proof due to the data lake habdling data growth
- No longer requires DE to setup complicated pipelines
- Data access security happens within data warehouse

# Advantages of ELT
- More data storage space required
- Could be slow due to muilti persistent of data
- Low compliance due to everything stored
- Security risk if not handled PII data correctly
- Fairly new technology due to popularity in cloud solutions

# DATA MODELLING & ERD NOTATION
#### Data Model:
- Foundation to building DWH & BI solutions
- Primary goal of the data model is to act as a blueprint
- Helps buidling conceptual, logic, physical and models and define relatiosnhips
- Defines how the logical structure of database is modeled
- Specifies business requirements and data structure
- Provides visual way to communicate with business at various level
- Data Model is important part of the developement process(main communication methid between team)

# Data Modelling
- Data modeling is the process itself
- identifying and anylyse business requiremennts
- Work with business on defining the dta model
   - Interview, meetings, reviewing existing process
- Define ERD notation style
   - Information Engineering(IE), Chen's Style, Barker UML
- Define the model type
  - Conceptual, Logic, Physical
- Define Data Modelling Methodology
  - Relational data Models (ER data model)
  - Dimension Model
